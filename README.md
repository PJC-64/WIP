This is a new vault for testing.  I will only add plugins as-needed for the functionality I am aiming to achieve.

Starting plugins are:
- MAKE.md - There are many reasons I use this plugin, including but not limited to:
	- Slash (/) menu.
	- Cover/Banner Image
	- Inline Editing (Flow Editor)
	- Spaces:
		  I haven't done much with spaces in my primary vault, usually going with my own modified CSS for the Files list.  This is, however, an area I want to explore -- especially as regards multiple spaces.
- Dataview - for data queries across the Vault.
- Templater - better control over templates than the built-in template formats.
- Periodic Notes - Daily/Weekly/Monthly notes
